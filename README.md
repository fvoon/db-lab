# Database Lab
A lab to showcase the common issues when using JPA and connection management in Spring Boot applications.
The lab is broken down in mainly 2 parts: (i) Database connection and (ii) Common misuse of JPA. This repository
has been set up in a way that by running the tests, we can see the duration taken to acquire or release a database connection.
Please visit the `complete` branch to see the suggested changes.
